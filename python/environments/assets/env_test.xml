<!-- this is a testing environment for rendering in mujoco 

this summary was derived by reading the documentation at:
https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/XMLreference.html#body-geom

for lights:
- pos: position of the light in the world frame
- dir: direction the light is pointing at
- diffuse: color of the light in RGB format


for geoms:
- name: a string name for the object
- type: plane, box, sphere, capsule, cylinder, ellipsoid (this is the type of object obviously)
- contype: what collision group(s) this geom belongs to
- conaffinity: what groups this geom can collide with
- pos: position of the geom in the world frame
- size: size parameters for the geom (depends on type)
- rgba: color of the geom in RGBA format
